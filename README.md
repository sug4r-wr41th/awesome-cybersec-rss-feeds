# Awesome Cyber-Security RSS Feeds
A curated list of RSS feeds about cyber-security topics.

But... why? After Twitter changed ownership and the community spread across BlueSky, Mastodon et al. and the new X was filled with aggressive ads, staying up-to-date in a "unified" way (i.e. a single app to monitor, scroll, etc) on trending topics in the cyber-security landscape became a pain in the ass, that's why I decided to switch back to the good old RSS protocol and create my custom (with a focus on security operations, threat intelligence and incident response) news feed.
